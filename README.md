**GOAL:** Estimate how heat exposure changes urban livability—proxied by
the rate of quality-of-life (QoL)-related 311
complaints per capita—controlling for environmental, socioeconomic, and urban morphology conditions across New York City tracts.

**QUESTION:** How does heat exposure influence urban livability—as
reflected in the proportion of QoL-related 311 service requests—across
census tracts in New York City, New York, after accounting for
environmental, socioeconomic, and urban morphology conditions?

-   Are some areas (e.g., hotter, lower-income, less green, more
    impervious) more sensitive to extreme heat in terms of 311 complaint
    activity?

-   Which characteristics amplify or buffer the effects of
    heat on perceived livability?

-   **Hypothesis 1:** Days with abnormally high heat will exhibit a
    higher percentage of quality-of-life-related 311 complaints compared
    with normal-heat weeks, controlling for other factors.

-   **Hypothesis 2:** Neighborhoods with greater tree canopy or higher
    NDVI will show a smaller increase in QoL-related complaints during
    hot periods, whereas areas with higher impervious surface will show
    a larger increase.

-   **Hypothesis 3:** The relationship between heat and QoL-related 311
    complaints will vary by socioeconomic status.

    -   Affluent areas may have increased reports due to bandwidth for
        higher civic engagement, lower tolerance for discomfort, and
        more knowledge on how to navigate the city services.

    -   Vulnerable areas may be more muted due to under-reporting, even
        if QoL and heat exposure disproportionately affect them.
