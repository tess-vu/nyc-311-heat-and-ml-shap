# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1. Research Background

## 1.2. Research Gap

few studies compare the mechanism difference between extreme heat day and regular heat day

## 1.3. Research Objective

# 2. METHODS

## 2.1. Study Area and Period

Philly; this summer; and how we define extreme heat days and extreme heat weeks

## 2.2. Data Preparation

## 2.3. OLS Regression Model

### Spatial Regression Model

Potentially spatial model? Not necessarily only if you found good results.

## 2.4. ML Model and SHAP

# 3. RESULTS

## 3.1. Exploratory Data Analysis

## 3.2. OLS Model Results

### Extreme Heat Model

### Normal Heat Model

## 3.3. ML and SHAP Results

### Extreme Heat Model

### Normal Heat Model

# 4. DISCUSSION

Results, and discuss about why the mechanism might be different and study limitations.
