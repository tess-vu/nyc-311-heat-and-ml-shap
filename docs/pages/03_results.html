<h2>3.1. Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<h2>3.2. OLS Model Results</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 Normal Heat Model</h3>
<p>In the OLS model for normal heat week QoF 311 report density, the overall F-statistic is strongly significant, indicating that the set of urban features jointly contributes meaningfully to explaining variation in reporting behavior. The R-squared of 0.084 shows that these predictors account for roughly 8% of the spatial variation, which presents a modest and low level of explanatory power that is typical for urban planning research on 311-based analyses. Such 311 outcomes reflect that service-request behavior is shaped by complex human responses, institutional factors, and informal social dynamics that are only partially captured by observable indicators. The relatively low R-squared also suggests the non-linear relationships might exist between urban features and 311 reporting behavior, indicating that machine-learning models may be more suitable for uncovering these non-linearities.</p>
<p>Regarding individual predictors, under the 0.05 significance threshold and within the linear OLS framework, seven features show statistically significant associations with QoF 311 report density during normal heat weeks: PCT_TREE_CANOPY, PCT_IMPERVIOUS, NDVI, POVERTY_RATE, PCT_NON_WHITE, BD, and AH. All remaining variables exhibit no significant linear effect. </p>
<h3>3.2.2 Extreme Heat Model</h3>
<p>In the OLS model for extreme heat–week QoF 311 report density, the overall F-statistic is highly significant, indicating that the set of urban features jointly provides meaningful explanatory power. The model's R-squared of 0.088 shows that these variables account for roughly 8–9% of the spatial variation, which also shows a limited explanatory power. The relatively low R-squared also suggests the non-linear relationships might exist between urban features and 311 reporting behavior in extreme heat weeks.</p>
<p>Regarding individual features, under the 0.05 significance threshold and the linearity assumption inherent to OLS, six features exhibit statistically significant associations with QoF 311 report density during extreme heat weeks: PCT_IMPERVIOUS, NDVI, POVERTY_RATE, PCT_NON_WHITE, BD, and AH. All other variables show no significant linear relationship after controlling for the rest of the model, implying that their effects may be weak, or more accurately represented through non-linear structures.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 OLS Comparison</h3>
<p>Across both the extreme-heat-week and normal-heat-week OLS models, only about half of the urban features exhibit statistically significant linear associations with QoF 311 report density, and both models yield low explanatory power (R² &lt; 0.10). This consistency indicates that the linear models capture only a small portion of the urban environmental, socioeconomic, and built indicators driving 311 reporting. Taken together, these results reinforce the limitations of linear OLS for this problem. They highlight the need for machine-learning approaches that can better capture non-linear effects, enabling a more precise comparison of how urban features influence 311 reporting differently under extreme heat versus normal heat conditions.</p>
<h2>3.3. ML and SHAP Results</h2>
<h3>3.3.1 ML Model Result</h3>
<p>Across both models, Random Forest substantially outperforms the OLS baseline, demonstrating the importance of non-linear and complex effects in explaining QoF 311 report density. For the regular heat week model, the test R2 reaches 0.274, over three times higher than the OLS R2 of approximately 0.08. Similarly, the extreme heat week model attains a test R^2of 0.246, again far exceeding the linear model but slightly lower than the regular heat scenario. This gap suggests that reporting behaviors during extreme heat is more variable and influenced by additional unobserved or volatile mechanisms. The clear improvements in model performance in both cases further confirm that machine-learning approaches capture substantial structure in the data that linear models fail to represent.</p>
<p>SHAP results reveal a consistent set of dominant predictors across both heat conditions. In each model, AH, PCT_NON_WHITE, and NDVI emerge as the three strongest contributors, reinforcing the central role of high-density residential morphology, socio-demographic composition, and environmental greenness in shaping QoF 311 reporting patterns. Several other predictors, such as subway accessibility, median income, WCR, poverty rate, and PCT_RENTERS, also exhibit meaningful non-linear contributions that were not visible in OLS, underscoring the value of ML models for uncovering complex behavioral responses.</p>
<h3>3.3.2 Extreme Heat vs Normal Heat</h3>
<p>Comparing the two heat conditions reveals both stability and notable shifts in feature influence. The hierarchy of the top three features, AH, PCT_NON_WHITE, and NDVI, remains consistent across models, suggesting that built form intensity, demographic composition, and vegetation coverage systematically shape reporting behaviors in both normal and extreme heat contexts. These stable high-importance variables reflect structural neighborhood characteristics whose effects persist regardless of temperature severity.</p>
<p>However, several features display meaningful changes in importance under extreme heat. WCR increases in influence in the extreme heat model, indicating that proximity to water bodies may play a more substantial role when heat stress intensifies, possibly reflecting shifts in human activity patterns or uneven access to cooling amenities. In contrast, some variables such as PCT_IMPERVIOUS, BD, and PCT_TREE_CANOPY show moderate decreases in relative importance, suggesting that physical morphology may matter slightly less once temperatures exceed critical thresholds and behavioral or socio-demographic factors take precedence. Overall, these patterns indicate that while the core drivers of 311 reporting remain stable, the marginal influence of secondary features is sensitive to heat severity, reinforcing the need for flexible modelling approaches to detect such context-dependent effects.</p>
