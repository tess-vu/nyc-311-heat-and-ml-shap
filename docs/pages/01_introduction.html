    <h2>Hot City, Heated Calls:<br>Understanding Extreme Heat and Quality of Life Using NYC's 311 and SHAP</h2>
        <h3 id="1-1-research-background">1.1. Research Background</h3>
            <p>Extreme heat is one of the deadliest environmental hazards in the United States and, while its effects are felt by everyone, they&#39;re also felt disproportionately. In dense, urban metropolitan cities like New York, extreme temperatures interact with not just the built environment and local infrastructure conditions, but also the socioeconomic climate—extreme heat acts as one of the many architects shaping where service disruptions, complaints, and other surrounding stressors occur, degrading quality-of-life (QoL) for urbanites, suburbanites, and ruralites alike.</p>
            <p>Within the context of this degradation is New York City&#39;s 311 service, a complaint system that accepts reports via calls, emails, and website submissions that can reflect extreme-heat induced behavior; it is a granular, real-time lens that provides understanding of how heat-related aggravation and other aspects can translate into observable, negative resident sentiment. This project in particular seeks to connect extreme heat versus normal heat weeks with environmental factors, socioeconomic conditions, and urban morphology to potentially explain QoL issues and their increases during hotter periods.</p>
            <p>In this regard, the project is built upon geospatial data science techniques for modeling weekly QoL outcomes, as proxied by selected 311 report categories, using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression modeling as a baseline followed by modern machine learning (ML) models RandomForest (RF) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).</p>
        <h3 id="1-2-research-gap">1.2. Research Gap</h3>
            <p>few studies compare the mechanism difference between extreme heat day and regular heat day</p>
        <h3 id="1-3-research-objective">1.3. Research Objective</h3>
            <p>With the research gap&#39;s context, this study asks: how do environmental, socioeconomic, and urban morphology factors influence the QoL in New York City, defined as QoL-related 311 report rate per capita, during extreme heat weeks versus normal heat weeks?</p>
            <p>Heat-related academic literature suggests that discomfort rises with temperature, so it is hypothesized that the QoL rate per capita will align with those findings. However, the objective of this research is to produce SHAP model values that can help reveal the drivers of QoL complaints in New York City.</p>
